## takeaways

I am never going to use Crystal again. Besides the shockingly poor tooling,
Windows support was never a priority which is a dealbreaker for me.

The language itself is thoroughly object oriented in a way that I don't really
like. I could see how some people'd like the "Ruby" style of object orientedness
but this shit's really not for me.
